Overview
========

Overall, the production of Microsoft’s Xbox has been a 
huge success with over 48 million Xbox Live subscribers 
worldwide. The Xbox vs Playsation debate is a debate 
that arises every time the two companies are close to 
releasing a console. The debates also arise when two 
friends have different consoles and cannot play 
together. Microsoft has just released a new Xbox, the 
Xbox One X, which actually released in November. The 
Xbox One X features allow you to play in 4k which is a 
brand new gaming experience to Xbox users. The Xbox had 
been said to have the more comfortable controllers and 
they also claim to make everything when making a ‘Party’ 
(Online chat with your friends via mic in the Xbox 
interface). Finally, there have been four consoles to be 
released as of this date and after each release, 
Microsoft has made it a priority to get rid of wires as 
well as making them smaller each console. For a company 
that first released a console in 2001 they have been 
doing very well!

Xbox 360
========

The Xbox 360 is the next step in Microsoft Gaming. This console was released in 2005 to match Sony’s PlayStation 3 and
Nintendo’s Wii this will be a common theme as we go through each console. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony competing with
consoles to run the gaming industry. The Xbox officially was released on MTV receiving major publicity, while having a
more detailed presentation about the console coming at E3, which is a gaming convention where a lot of gaming companies
choose to release games that are coming out in that year. Microsoft later released a smaller, slimmer, sleeker version 
of the Xbox 360 to be shipped out later only this came with motion sensing technology which Microsoft called the Kinect. 
Kinect games were made and thus opening up and new market for Microsoft. Companies of games that used Nintendo’s Wii and 
their motion sensing remotes could now partner with Microsoft and their Xbox to get game such as Just Dance on the new 
console. Microsoft also released a new Xbox Live streaming service which was free and therefore didn’t provide nearly 
all the perks.

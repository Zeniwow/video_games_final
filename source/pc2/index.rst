Gaming PC's- The guts
=====================

Every gaming computer has the same basic components:
 
* a CPU (Central Processing Unit)
* a graphics card of some sort (practically required for any modern games)
* a motherboard, Memory, storage drive (commonly SSD or HDD)
* a power supply unit
* a cooling system
* and finally a case

CPU’s have come a long way since gaming computers came about and currently the brands Intel and AMD dominate the market. Today, most gaming computers are being built with either Intel’s Kaby lake series or AMD’s Ryzen series CPU’s. 
Graphics Cards have made tremendous progress as well and currently NVIDIA and AMD dominate that market. NVIDIA’s current top lineup include their GTX 10 series cards with their flagship card being the GTX Titan X coming in at a staggering $1200.00 per card. AMD has responded with their Radeon R series cards which, although not as popular as NVIDA, still control a sizeable portion of the market. 
Motherboards have for quite some time been made with integrated graphics and network capabilities. There are many different brands and many different price points for motherboards but they have diversified in their sizes. You can now build computers with full ATX, mini ATX, or ITX sized motherboards for those who want a compact system. 
The typical memory installed into gaming computers today is around 16gb of DDR4 memory in a dual stick configuration. 
Storage device began using hard drives but have recently began migrating towards a SSD or solid state drive model. 
Power supplies have become quite efficient and cases have become elaborate, highly functional, customizable, and good at sound-proofing internal fans. 
Finally, cooling systems consist of either a heat sink and fan setup, or a liquid cooling setup that involves a radiator and pump. In both cases, designs have become very efficient at pulling heat away from components and rapidly expelling it.

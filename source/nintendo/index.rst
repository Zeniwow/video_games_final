History of Nintendo
===================

During the year of 1989, Fusajiro Yamauchi, a Japenese man,
began to make playing cards called "Hanafuda".  This was
seen as the first step in the creation of what we know as
Nintendo.  13 years later, Yamauchi created a western-style
playing card.  These became popular not only in Japan, but 
all over the world and this led into the creation of 
Yamauchi Nintendo & Co in 1933.  In 1950, Hioshi Yamauchi,
the great grandson of Fusajiro, became President of the 
company changing the name to Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd.
in 1951.  It wasn't until 1974 when the technology of 
Nintendo began to take affect.  The Nintendo corporation 
created an image-projection system used in arcades.  This 
image-projection system was a 16mm film projector and at 
this time America found great interest and these machines 
started to get exported into the US.  A year later, Nintendo 
generated a video game system and once they got the baseline for 
a video game system they took it one step further and in 1977 
they started to develop home-use video games instead of 
arcade only machines.  This is where the Nintendo became 
what we know as Nintendo today.

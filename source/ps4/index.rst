PlayStation VR
==============

PlayStation VR is Playstations foot in the door to virtual reality systems. Coming
in at $349 and the need of a playStation 4 and a game, it is quite expensive. Not
a lot of people own the VR. Pries continue to drop though, at release the PlayStation VR was $400. Current competitors include: Oculus Rift, HTC Vive,
Samsung Gear VR, and the Google Daydream View. With these highly regarded companies,
PlayStation will have to step up their game to compete with them. 

PlayStation has not made any more versions of the VR. They seem to be taking a
break to focus on their rumored PlayStation 5. Hopefully in the future we see
the fully potential of virtual reality and possibly make it the everyday gaming
system. But for now we will stick with the occasional games to impress our friends
and have a fun time with one another.

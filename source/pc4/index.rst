The Glory of the Finished Product
=================================

In the end having a gaming level PC, either bought or built, can give you the best gaming experience possible. No gaming console system out today can match the pure graphics processing power of a modern gaming PC. Only with a gaming PC can you run the most demanding new games in their highest settings while simultaneously watching a stream or video on the internet.

Custom Builds
-------------

Many PC gamers today choose to build their own systems using the parts mentioned in previous pages. Gamers do this for a few reasons. First, you can build a gaming system yourself and save money instead of paying someone else or a company to build it for you thus giving the system a higher performance per dollar value. Secondly, building your own gaming PC can be a fun learning experience and thereâ€™s nothing as satisfying than flipping the on switch for the first time and having the build spring to life. People may still choose to buy a pre-built system simply for the ease of use and because there are no programming skills required. Below is an example of a build I am currently working on that will soon replace an old gaming laptop.

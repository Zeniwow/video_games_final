About PlayStation
=================

PlayStation is owned by Sony, a technology entertainment company. Sony's 
product line not only includes the PlayStation but also has TV, audio, cameras, 
and cell phones. Sony just doesn't make products, they also make movies and 
music with Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music.

PlayStation has the most sold gaming system ever with their PlayStation 2.
Compared to its rival, the Xbox, PlayStation always out sells Xbox. Thanks to the
help of PlayStation exclusives and cheaper prices.

With the introduction of PlayStation VR, PlayStation hopes to expand itself to
new clients. The VR system uses a headset, two motion controllers, and a camera. Currently there are only a few games that work with the VR but hopefully there 
will be more in the future. As of right now the PlayStation VR set is about the
same price as the PlayStation itself at $349.

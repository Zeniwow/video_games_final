PlayStation 4 Pro
=================

PlayStation has really outdone themselves this time. They took the PlayStation 4
and put it on another level, literally. PlayStaition stacked another tier onto 
the system to help house the new 2.1GHz 8-core AMD Jaguar CPU and the 4.2 TFLOP
AMD Radeon GPU. This results in a 30% CPU boost and a 100% GPU boost. With all
that power the PlayStation 4 Pro is able to stream and play games in 4k.

The PlayStation 4 Pro comes with a 1TB hard drive, dualshock 4 controller, HDMI
cable, and power cable. Everything you need to get started. You can upgrade to a
bundle for a little more.
